          <nom>Pryce, Jonathan</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Price, John</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Jonathan Pryce was born on June 1, 1947, in Holywell, Wales. His father, named Isaac Price, was a coal miner, who died in 1976. His mother, named Margaret Ellen (nee Williams), was a retail cashier. He left the home of his parents at age 16 to attend an art school, where he became interested in drama. At some point he changed the spelling of his last name from Price to Pryce. He studied acting on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After graduation from RADA, he joined the Liverpool Everyman Theatre and eventually became its Artistic Director.  In the 1970s Pryce established himself on the London stage with appearances in 'The Taming of the Shrew', 'Hamlet', and 'Measure for Measure' among other plays. He won the 1977 Tony Award for his Broadway debut in 'Comedians', for which he also earned the 1977 Theatre World Award and the 1977 nomination for Drama Desk Outstanding Actor Award. Pryce earned his second Tony Award 15 years later for the role as "The Engineer", a half-Vietnamese/half French pimp in 'Miss Saigon'. Pryce created the role in the original London production and agreed to reprise the role on Broadway in a transplant of the same production. Despite controversy over his appearance -- the actors union decried the long-standing practice of hiring white actors to play Asian or Eurasian characters, especially given the paucity of roles for Asian characters, and it also objected to the producer's refusal to even audition any Asian actors -- he gave a brilliant performance.  In 1976 Pryce made his big screen debut in _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv). But it wasn't until 1983 that he made a strong impression with his scary performance as a freaky manipulative Mr. Dark in Ray Bradbury's _Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)_ (qv). Pryce shot to fame with _Brazil (1985)_ (qv) and his role as Sam Lowry, a technocrat trying to correct an error caused by a bug and himself becomes entangled in psychopathic bureaucracy eventually becoming an enemy of the state. He also filled such strong and authoritative roles, as president Juan Peron opposite Madonna in _Evita (1996)_ (qv), then co-starred opposite Pierce Brosnan as Elliot Carver, the evil megalomaniac media mogul in the 18th Bond film, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv).  Pryce's versatility and multifaceted talent rarely had a chance to take him beyond playing freaks and villains in film, an imposed forte which he, however, managed to overcome in his numerous stage performances and in a few film and TV works. He went on playing a range of characters marked with sophistication and depth, such as his subtle and nuanced portrayal of author Lytton Strachey in _Carrington (1995)_ (qv), for which he won the Best Actor Award at Cannes. Pryce also shone in musicals 'My Fair Lady' and 'Oliver' to name just a few. Pryce made numerous works for television ranging from costume dramas to comedy, and from narrations to singing. In January 2006, he replaced John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson in the acclaimed musical version of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'. He appeared as the timid Jamaican Governor Wetherby Swann in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)_ (qv), and the sequel _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)_ (qv), and the third installment of the Pirates franchise, _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)_ (qv).  Jonathan Pryce has been with his partner, actress Kate Fahy, since 1974 when they met at the Everyman Theatre Liverpool Company, though they have never married. They have two sons, Patrick (born 1983) and Gabriel (born 1986), and one daughter, Phoebe (born 1990). Pryce and Fahy also co-starred in the 2004 production of 'The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?'. Fahy and Pryce reside with their family in England.</biographie>

          <biographie>Pierce Brosnan was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and lived in Navan, County Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability to play men from both backgrounds convincingly). His father left the household when Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and Sean from their marriage. Since her death, he has had two children with his second wife, 'Keely Shaye Smith' (qv).</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Butler, Gerard James</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Born in Paisley, Scotland, to Margaret and Edward Butler, Gerard Butler was raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley, Scotland. He also spent some of his youth in Canada. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school's law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.  His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor 'Steven Berkoff (I)' (qv), who later appeared alongside Butler in _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv), who gave him a role in a stage production of "Coriolanus". After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as 'Ewan McGregor' (qv)'s character "Renton" in the stage adaptation of [i]Trainspotting[/i]. His film debut was as 'Billy Connolly (I)' (qv)'s younger brother in _Mrs Brown (1997)_ (qv). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.  His film career continued with small roles, first in the "James Bond" movie, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv), and then 'Russell Mulcahy' (qv)'s _Tale of the Mummy (1998)_ (qv). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being "Attila the Hun" in the USA Network mini-series, _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler's screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time "Attila" was being filmed, casting was in progress for 'Wes Craven' (qv)'s new take on the "Dracula" legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn't much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of "Attila". Evidently, they saw something because _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila's producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film's ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere.  Since then, he has appeared in _Reign of Fire (2002)_ (qv) as "Creedy" and _Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003)_ (qv) as "Terry Sheridan", alongside 'Angelina Jolie' (qv). The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of "Andre Marek" in the big-screen adaptation of 'Michael Crichton' (qv)'s novel, _Timeline (2003)_ (qv). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in 'Andrew Lloyd Webber' (qv)'s musical, _The Phantom of the Opera (2004)_ (qv), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include _Dear Frankie (2004)_ (qv), _The Game of Their Lives (2005)_ (qv) and _Beowulf &amp; Grendel (2005)_ (qv).  In 2007, he starred as Spartan "King Leonidas" in the Warner Bros. production _300 (2006)_ (qv), based on the 'Frank Miller (II)' (qv) graphic novel, and _Butterfly on a Wheel (2007)_ (qv), co-starring 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) and 'Maria Bello' (qv), which aired on network TV under the title, "Shattered". He most recently starred in _P.S. I Love You (2007)_ (qv), with Academy Award-winner 'Hilary Swank' (qv).  In 2007, he appeared in _Nim's Island (2008)_ (qv) and _RocknRolla (2008)_ (qv), and completed the new 'Mark Neveldine' (qv) / 'Brian Taylor (V)' (qv) film, _Gamer (2009)_ (qv). His next films included _The Ugly Truth (2009)_ (qv), co-starring 'Katherine Heigl' (qv), which began filming in April 2008, _The Bounty Hunter (2010/I)_ (qv), _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), _Chasing Mavericks (2012)_ (qv) and _Olympus Has Fallen (2013)_ (qv). Butler is also a relative of rising animator and film director 'Mark Flood (III)' (qv).</biographie>

          <nom>Llewelyn, Desmond</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Llewelyn, Desmond Wilkinson</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago."</biographie>

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied" (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Hatcher, Teri Lynn</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Teri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, USA, as the only child of Owen and Esther Hatcher, and grew up in nearby Sunnyvale, California. Her father is a nuclear physicist and her mother is a computer programmer. She spent her childhood dancing and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted "Most Likely to Become a _"Solid Gold" (1980)_ (qv) Dancer" by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.  Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series _"The Love Boat" (1977)_ (qv). She went on to play "Penny Parker," a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on _"MacGyver" (1985)_ (qv). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy "Lois Lane" on _"Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" (1993)_ (qv), saying that she didn't want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as "Penny Parker."  She married actor 'Jon Tenney' (qv) in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter 'Emerson Tenney' (qv) on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play "Sally Bowles" in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera _"Desperate Housewives" (2004)_ (qv), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, "Susan Mayer," was consistently named as America's favorite "Desperate Housewife." Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show's first season was even over.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Chu-Kheng, Yeoh</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Born as Yang Zi Chong in the mining town of Ipoh in West Malaysia in the lunar year of the Tiger, she spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star 'Jackie Chan (I)' (qv). In 1985, she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes.  She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her. In 1988, she married wealthy D&amp;B Films executive 'Dickson Poon' (qv) and retired from acting. Even though they divorced in 1992, she is close to Poon's second wife and a godmother to Poon's daughter. When she returned to acting, she became very popular to Chinese audiences and she became known to western audiences through her co-starring roles in the James Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and in the phenomenally successful _Wo hu cang long (2000)_ (qv) aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' directed by 'Ang Lee' (qv). She turned down a role in a sequel to _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv).  She has her own production company, Mythical Films and has trained with the Shen Yang Acrobatic team for her role in _Tian mai zhuan qi (2002)_ (qv), an English language film she is both starring in and producing. She hopes to use her company to discover and nurture new filmmaking talent. She also wants to act in roles that combine both action and deeper spiritual themes.</biographie>

      <synopsis>Agent 007, the unstoppable action hero must prevent a tremendous disaster ripped from tomorrow's headlines. Someone is pitting the world's superpowers against each other - and only James Bond can stop it. When a British warship is mysteriously destroyed in Chinese waters, the world teeters on the brink of World War III - until 007 zeros in on the true criminal mastermind. Bond's do-or-die mission takes him to Elliot Carver, a powerful media mogul who manipulates world events as easily as he changes headlines from his global media empire. After soliciting help from Carver's sexy wife, Paris, Bond join forces with a stunning yet lethal Chinese agent, Wai Lin, in a series of explosive chases, brutal confrontations and breathtaking escapes as they race to stop the presses on Carver's next planned news story: global pandemonium!</synopsis>

          <nom>Pryce, Jonathan</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Price, John</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Jonathan Pryce was born on June 1, 1947, in Holywell, Wales. His father, named Isaac Price, was a coal miner, who died in 1976. His mother, named Margaret Ellen (nee Williams), was a retail cashier. He left the home of his parents at age 16 to attend an art school, where he became interested in drama. At some point he changed the spelling of his last name from Price to Pryce. He studied acting on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After graduation from RADA, he joined the Liverpool Everyman Theatre and eventually became its Artistic Director.  In the 1970s Pryce established himself on the London stage with appearances in 'The Taming of the Shrew', 'Hamlet', and 'Measure for Measure' among other plays. He won the 1977 Tony Award for his Broadway debut in 'Comedians', for which he also earned the 1977 Theatre World Award and the 1977 nomination for Drama Desk Outstanding Actor Award. Pryce earned his second Tony Award 15 years later for the role as "The Engineer", a half-Vietnamese/half French pimp in 'Miss Saigon'. Pryce created the role in the original London production and agreed to reprise the role on Broadway in a transplant of the same production. Despite controversy over his appearance -- the actors union decried the long-standing practice of hiring white actors to play Asian or Eurasian characters, especially given the paucity of roles for Asian characters, and it also objected to the producer's refusal to even audition any Asian actors -- he gave a brilliant performance.  In 1976 Pryce made his big screen debut in _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv). But it wasn't until 1983 that he made a strong impression with his scary performance as a freaky manipulative Mr. Dark in Ray Bradbury's _Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)_ (qv). Pryce shot to fame with _Brazil (1985)_ (qv) and his role as Sam Lowry, a technocrat trying to correct an error caused by a bug and himself becomes entangled in psychopathic bureaucracy eventually becoming an enemy of the state. He also filled such strong and authoritative roles, as president Juan Peron opposite Madonna in _Evita (1996)_ (qv), then co-starred opposite Pierce Brosnan as Elliot Carver, the evil megalomaniac media mogul in the 18th Bond film, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv).  Pryce's versatility and multifaceted talent rarely had a chance to take him beyond playing freaks and villains in film, an imposed forte which he, however, managed to overcome in his numerous stage performances and in a few film and TV works. He went on playing a range of characters marked with sophistication and depth, such as his subtle and nuanced portrayal of author Lytton Strachey in _Carrington (1995)_ (qv), for which he won the Best Actor Award at Cannes. Pryce also shone in musicals 'My Fair Lady' and 'Oliver' to name just a few. Pryce made numerous works for television ranging from costume dramas to comedy, and from narrations to singing. In January 2006, he replaced John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson in the acclaimed musical version of 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'. He appeared as the timid Jamaican Governor Wetherby Swann in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)_ (qv), and the sequel _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)_ (qv), and the third installment of the Pirates franchise, _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)_ (qv).

His father left the household when Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and Sean from their marriage.

          <nom>Butler, Gerard</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Butler, Gerard James</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Born in Paisley, Scotland, to Margaret and Edward Butler, Gerard Butler was raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley, Scotland. He also spent some of his youth in Canada. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school's law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.  His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor 'Steven Berkoff (I)' (qv), who later appeared alongside Butler in _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv), who gave him a role in a stage production of "Coriolanus". After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as 'Ewan McGregor' (qv)'s character "Renton" in the stage adaptation of [i]Trainspotting[/i]. His film debut was as 'Billy Connolly (I)' (qv)'s younger brother in _Mrs Brown (1997)_ (qv). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.  His film career continued with small roles, first in the "James Bond" movie, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv), and then 'Russell Mulcahy' (qv)'s _Tale of the Mummy (1998)_ (qv). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being "Attila the Hun" in the USA Network mini-series, _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler's screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time "Attila" was being filmed, casting was in progress for 'Wes Craven' (qv)'s new take on the "Dracula" legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn't much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of "Attila". Evidently, they saw something because _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila's producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film's ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere.  Since then, he has appeared in _Reign of Fire (2002)_ (qv) as "Creedy" and _Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003)_ (qv) as "Terry Sheridan", alongside 'Angelina Jolie' (qv). The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of "Andre Marek" in the big-screen adaptation of 'Michael Crichton' (qv)'s novel, _Timeline (2003)_ (qv). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in 'Andrew Lloyd Webber' (qv)'s musical, _The Phantom of the Opera (2004)_ (qv), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include _Dear Frankie (2004)_ (qv), _The Game of Their Lives (2005)_ (qv) and _Beowulf &amp; Grendel (2005)_ (qv).  In 2007, he starred as Spartan "King Leonidas" in the Warner Bros. production _300 (2006)_ (qv), based on the 'Frank Miller (II)' (qv) graphic novel, and _Butterfly on a Wheel (2007)_ (qv), co-starring 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) and 'Maria Bello' (qv), which aired on network TV under the title, "Shattered". He most recently starred in _P.S. I Love You (2007)_ (qv), with Academy Award-winner 'Hilary Swank' (qv).  In 2007, he appeared in _Nim's Island (2008)_ (qv) and _RocknRolla (2008)_ (qv), and completed the new 'Mark Neveldine' (qv) / 'Brian Taylor (V)' (qv) film, _Gamer (2009)_ (qv). His next films included _The Ugly Truth (2009)_ (qv), co-starring 'Katherine Heigl' (qv), which began filming in April 2008, _The Bounty Hunter (2010/I)_ (qv), _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), _Chasing Mavericks (2012)_ (qv) and _Olympus Has Fallen (2013)_ (qv). Butler is also a relative of rising animator and film director 'Mark Flood (III)' (qv).</biographie>

          <biographie>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago."</biographie>

          <nom>Baker, Joe Don</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied" (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Hatcher, Teri Lynn</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Teri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, USA, as the only child of Owen and Esther Hatcher, and grew up in nearby Sunnyvale, California. Her father is a nuclear physicist and her mother is a computer programmer. She spent her childhood dancing and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted "Most Likely to Become a _"Solid Gold" (1980)_ (qv) Dancer" by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.  Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series _"The Love Boat" (1977)_ (qv). She went on to play "Penny Parker," a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on _"MacGyver" (1985)_ (qv). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy "Lois Lane" on _"Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" (1993)_ (qv), saying that she didn't want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as "Penny Parker."  She married actor 'Jon Tenney' (qv) in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter 'Emerson Tenney' (qv) on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play "Sally Bowles" in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera _"Desperate Housewives" (2004)_ (qv), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, "Susan Mayer," was consistently named as America's favorite "Desperate Housewife." Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show's first season was even over.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Chu-Kheng, Yeoh</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Born as Yang Zi Chong in the mining town of Ipoh in West Malaysia in the lunar year of the Tiger, she spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star 'Jackie Chan (I)' (qv). In 1985, she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes.  She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her. In 1988, she married wealthy D&amp;B Films executive 'Dickson Poon' (qv) and retired from acting. Even though they divorced in 1992, she is close to Poon's second wife and a godmother to Poon's daughter. When she returned to acting, she became very popular to Chinese audiences and she became known to western audiences through her co-starring roles in the James Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and in the phenomenally successful _Wo hu cang long (2000)_ (qv) aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' directed by 'Ang Lee' (qv). She turned down a role in a sequel to _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv).  She has her own production company, Mythical Films and has trained with the Shen Yang Acrobatic team for her role in _Tian mai zhuan qi (2002)_ (qv), an English language film she is both starring in and producing. She hopes to use her company to discover and nurture new filmmaking talent. She also wants to act in roles that combine both action and deeper spiritual themes.</biographie>

      <titre>Ocean's Thirteen</titre>
      <synopsis>The last time we saw Danny Ocean's crew, they were paying back ruthless casino mogul Terry Benedict after stealing millions from him. However, it's been a while since they've come back together, which is all about to change. When one of their own, Reuben Tishkoff, builds a hotel with another casino owner, Willy Bank, the last thing he ever wanted was to get cut out of the deal personally by the loathsome Bank. Bank's attitude even goes so far as to finding the amusement in Tishkoff's misfortune when the double crossing lands Reuben in the hospital because of a heart attack. However, Danny and his crew won't stand for Bank and what he's done to a friend. Uniting with their old enemy Benedict, who himself has a vendetta against Bank, the crew is out to pull off a major plan; one that will unfold on the night Bank's newest hot spot opens up. They're not in this for the money, but for the revenge.</synopsis>

          <nom>Reiner, Carl</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his "10,000 Year Old Man" album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his "angels" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _"The Fashion Story" (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _"The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue" (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical "Inside U.S.A.", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, "Alive and Kicking", was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _"Your Show of Shows" (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing "The Professor", a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, "Your Show of Shows" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _"Caesar's Hour" (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  "Your Show or Shows" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas "Caesar's Hour" was pure comedy. "Your Show of Shows" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to "Caesar's Hour". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during "Your Show of Shows", but he began writing formally for "Caesar's Hour", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited "writer without portfolio", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, "Man of the House", in which he would play a writer, "Rob Petrie", who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a "benign despot" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv), and their routine "The 2000 Year Old Man" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down "Man of the House", with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of "Rob Petrie" to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of "Alan Brady", the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of "Alan Brady" on _"Mad About You" (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _"The Cleveland Show" (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his "Your Show of Shows" experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _"Hot in Cleveland" (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _"Parks and Recreation" (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biographie>

          <nom>DuMont, James</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Born and raised in Chicago and New York City, James DuMont was destined for television; his great Uncle Alan B. DuMont created the DuMont Television Network of the '40's and '50's, which featured Jackie Gleason in "The Honeymooners", filmed on DuMont television cameras and broadcast in homes on DuMont TVs. James began his career in Chicago as a child model as the 1966 Gerber Baby. Modeling led to television commercials for McDonald's and Sears and professional theatre where he performed in "Peter Pan &amp; Oliver Twist". At the age of 10, James was paid to DJ at Dingbat's Disco in Chicago, where the local bouncer was Mr. T and his DJ mentor was none other than the originator of House Music DJ Larry Levan. This eventually led to his DJing at the famed Studio 54 in NYC and then to his performing with the Joffrey Ballet starring Rudolph Nureyev. DuMont got his SAG card by dancing in the street to Ray Charles in "The Blues Brothers." He then booked his first speaking role in the classic 80's film "Class" with Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy. James attended Whitney Young High School with the future First Lady Michelle Obama and was in the 100th graduating class of Evanston Township High School, known for it's actor alumni, which includes John &amp; Joan Cusack and Jeremy Piven. In his senior year, James starred in a production of "The Diary of Anne Frank" (which was attended by many Holocaust survivors).  James went to Boston University where he continued to act in Theatre and DJ. In between his sophomore and junior years, James booked the play "American Buffalo" in NYC, and was offered company membership with Ensemble Studio Theatre (EST) working with then up-and-coming playwrights John Patrick Shanley, Richard Greenberg and Craig Lucas. After leaving BU for NYC, James worked steadily in Theatre, discovered Buddhism (which he still practices today) and made his Broadway debut in the highly lauded play "Six Degrees of Separation" (which nudity was required for the part). Working opposite Stockard Channing and Courtney B. Vance. Journalist George Plimpton wrote a piece for Esquire Magazine about James and his experience as "the Nudist Buddhist." After "Six Degrees of Separation" closed, James performed in "Throwing Your Voice" co-starring Mary Louise-Parker, Brooke Smith, and Sam Robards in EST's One Act Marathon. This earned James rave reviews. James then decided to 'go nude' once more in the National Tour of "Six Degrees."  When that tour ended, James moved to Los Angeles, where he helped create EST-The LA Project (EST/LA), producing and developing over 200 plays. EST/LA performed at the US Comedy Arts Fest in Aspen where the company won the 'Best of the Fest' Award. During this time, DuMont worked on such TV series as "The George Carlin Show" and recurred as Ralph (the tabloid reporter) on "Lois &amp; Clark." He also appeared in such memorable Films as: "Speed", "S.W.A.T", "Catch Me If You Can" , "War of the Worlds", "Seabiscuit" and "Ocean's 13."  Leading roles in Showtime's "Enemies Among Us" and "The Cellar Door" (which James co-produced and won the 'Best Actor' award as well as 'Best Feature'Award at 'Shreikfest' in Hollywood) soon followed. James also produced "The Confession", winning 20 of 25 international film festivals, with Michael Moore ("Bowling For Columbine") calling it "One of the darkest, funniest shorts I have ever seen." James co-produced the Feature Film "Statistics", which won the Audience Award at the Silverlake Film Festival, produced and starred in the critically acclaimed Theatre productions of "Serious Games" &amp; "Morphic Resonance" which won both the LA Weekly Award for Best Ensemble and the Los Angeles Times 'Critic's Choice Award'.  James DuMont has recurred on two critically acclaimed Television series: HBO's "Treme" (opposite Oscar winning actress Melissa Leo) and TNT's "Men Of A Certain Age" (opposite 4-time Emmy winning actor Ray Romano). James has four upcoming Feature Films: "Barefoot" with Evan Rachel Wood &amp; Scott Speedman, "Baytown Outlaws" with Billy Bob Thornton, "Universal Soldier - A New Dimenson" with Scott Adkins and "Rock Jocks" with Andrew Bowen (Mad TV). Recent TV Credits include Mad Men, Harry's Law &amp; Rizzoli &amp; Isles.  With over 95 major Feature Films and Television Shows and over 20 National commercials under his belt, James' career is showing no signs of slowing down. James is developing 3 Feature Films with his producing partners in NYC, LA and Louisiana and revising his one-man-play "My Life As A DJ". Residing in both Los Angeles and Louisiana, James considers himself "Bayou Costal".</biographie>

          <nom>Harney, Michael</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>An actor on television since the early 1990s, Michael Harney frequently essayed tough men with deeply complicated interior lives in such acclaimed series as "NYPD Blue" (ABC 1993-2005), "Deadwood" (HBO 2005-2006) and "Weeds" (Showtime 2005-2012). Harney's ability to tap into the emotional and spiritual elements of his characters was the result of substantial training and work on the New York theater scene, as well as his early career path as a social worker and prison reform advocate. After years of anonymity on the Off-Broadway circuit, Harney earned his big break as a morally compromised police officer on "Blue," which led to steady work as a guest performer on countless series. In 2005, he played a hateful townsperson on "Deadwood," which further increased his profile; he successful transitioned from recurring turns on various series, including an alcoholic detective on "Weeds," to his first turn as a series regular on "Orange is the New Black" (2013).</biographie>

          <nom>Affleck, Casey</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Affleck, Caleb Casey</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of 'Ben Affleck' (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor's degree.  Affleck's first major film role was in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) and 'Nicole Kidman' (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which 'Ben Affleck' (qv) co-wrote with 'Matt Damon' (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Matt Damon' (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean's Eleven's ensemble cast. Affleck's character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) in the "hoax-umentary" _I'm Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married 'Summer Phoenix' (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biographie>

          <biographie>Blue-eyed Vincent Cassel was born in Paris to a leading French actor father, 'Jean-Pierre Cassel' (qv) and a journalist mother. Often labeled as a tough guy because of his roles, eclectic choices and talent have made of him a star of European cinema. First in _La haine (1995)_ (qv), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside 'Jean Reno (I)' (qv), made of him "the man to count on." He never hid his taste for rap music, break dance, Capoeira, Brasil and his endless energy, but Vincent is also a family man, married to 'Monica Bellucci' (qv), his Italian co-star from _L'appartement (1996)_ (qv) (aka The Apartment); and recently a father.</biographie>

The next morning she tracked down the school drama teacher and gave her no choice but to get her in a drama class. Thus began her career as an actor.  It wasn't Charlie's Angels that launched her acting career, it was playing the heroine. She beat out over 10,000 actors who came to Las Vegas to compete for Star Trek The Experience roles. For the next seven years she bravely battled aliens as an officer on the Starship Enterprise. Her ability to save the human race was so impressive, it landed her a lead in the sci-fi feature, War of the Planets.  Shae is much more than an alien fighter. She has continued to grow in diversity through study and challenging roles in TV, film, theater, and commercials. For example in Ocean's 13, she played the soft spoken ticket agent alongside a star studded cast. Her portrayal of an harassed cocktail waitress on America's Most Wanted was so moving,, it led to the capture of an at-large criminal. She won the hearts of audiences and critics as Toby in the stage production of Niel Simon's"The Gingerbread Lady." Her charisma and naturalness in front of the camera have landed her with many commercials.  Her lifelong passion for creating characters and performing spills over into improv. As an understudy with the world-famous Second City Comedy Troupe, her kooky-and convincing--characters kept audiences rolling in the aisles.  Shae compliments her acting as a talented singer and dancer, which makes her a triple treat. She has wowed audiences around the country as Florence Ballard in an ensemble that impersonates the Supremes and placed first in several hip hop dance contests!  Shae gives back by sharing her gift in nonpaying productions. Most recently she played a woman twice her age in "The Party" at a retirement center. During the meet and greet, residents were shocked to learn that she wasn't one of them.  Shae expresses equally intense passion and dedication in her biggest roles of all-mother, daughter, sister and friend. She is grateful for the love and support of those around her who constantly reminder that no matter how tough the business gets, "Nobody puts baby in a corner."</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Sands, Julian Richard Morley</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Tall, gaunt--particularly in horror and drama films--British actor Julian Sands came to the attention of NBC when the network cast him in the made-for-TV _"The Sun Also Rises" (1984)_ (qv) and then with 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) in the television film _"A Married Man" (1983)_ (qv). Sands also got notice in his very small roles in _Privates on Parade (1983)_ (qv) and _The Killing Fields (1984)_ (qv). It wasn't until his funny and romantic role opposite 'Denholm Elliott' (qv) in _A Room with a View (1985)_ (qv) and then his unusual role in _Gothic (1986)_ (qv) that audiences noticed him and were fascinated with his good looks and unusual but sometimes chilling appearance. He continued work on screen in _Vibes (1988)_ (qv), _Impromptu (1991)_ (qv) and 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s _Arachnophobia (1990)_ (qv), until his most remembered role as _Warlock (1989)_ (qv), directed by 'Steve Miner (I)' (qv). The film was such a major success that he returned for the terrifying sequel, _Warlock: The Armageddon (1993)_ (qv). His other credits include _Naked Lunch (1991)_ (qv), _Tale of a Vampire (1992)_ (qv) and the title role in 'Dario Argento' (qv)'s _The Phantom of the Opera (1990) (TV)_ (qv). Sands has more recently been in 'Stephen King (I)' (qv)'s _"Rose Red" (2002)_ (qv) and is also occasionally seen on the English stage.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Purcell, Robert Douglas</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Robert Douglas Purcell grew up in the small town of Scituate, which is located on the south shore of Massachusetts. He had a talent for art in school, graduated early from Scituate High School's Class of 1976 and joined the Marines. He has lived in California since 1982, was married in 1985 and divorced in 2003. He has two beautiful daughters.  Purcell has worked steadily in film, television and commercials. Stage credits include performances as "Major Roberts" in Layon Gray's acclaimed WWII play, Black Angels Over Tuskegee (2009), "Murray" in the New Voices/OC Playwrights Alliance production of Christmas In Pakistan (2007), "Bobby" in the Dillstar West production of The Soprano's Last Supper, and "Petruchio" in the Newport Beach Repertory production of The Haunting of Will Shakespeare. Although often cast as the authority figure, such as the "Police Officer" in the short film, The Silent (2006), the villainous Army General "Agamemnon" in the award winning short, Cassandra (2006) or the "Slot Machine Pit Boss" opposite Al Pacino in Ocean's Thirteen (2007), Purcell lists some of the more off-beat characters he has played as personal favorites. They include the down and out ex-boxer, ex-mafia tough guy "Joe" in the faith-based feature film, Faith Happens (2005) and the gay "Bartender" in the feature film, Hollywood, Je T'aime (2009).  Purcell can be seen as the Angels Pitching Coach, the Umpire and annoying Sports Writer in several television commercials for Howard's TV &amp; Appliances, featuring Angels manager, Mike Scioscia and 2nd baseman, Howie Kendrick. His voice (as various characters) can be heard in several humorous Howard's TV "Halo Hotline" radio spots during the L.A. Angels of Anaheim '07-'09 baseball seasons.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Winfrey, Orpah Gail</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Born Orpah Gail Winfrey in Kosciusko, Mississippi, United States. Orpah was born to mother, former maid Vernita Lee, and father, war veteran Vermon Winfrey. Oprah Gail Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century, however Orpah Gail Winfrey wasn't born into a rich, or even middle class family. Orpah Gail Winfrey was born in an economically troubled neighborhood and raised by a single-teenaged mother in the city of Milwaukee. Orpah, named after a biblical character, had a name no one could pronounce, so her family and friends starting calling her Oprah. Shortly after Oprah's birth, Vernita Lee left her daughter and traveled north. Oprah was then raised by her grandmother,Hatti Mae Lee. Oprah while being raised by her grandmother lived in terrible conditions. Oprah's only friends were farm animals,however even at that age Oprah had a very imaginative mind. Oprah would frequently give the animals dramatic parts and included them in games. This was perhaps where she had gotten the craze for acting, and would soon be seen in legendary masterpieces such as The Color Purple. Oprah because of her grandmother's values, had religion and God instilled in herself at a very young age. Oprah because of her grandmother knew how to read,and write before the age of three. Oprah during church would recite poems,and verses from the bible. Soon the church, and the entire neighborhood knew she had a gift and was nicknamed,"The Little Speaker". This would soon prompt her to become a woman with a strong perspective, which millions across the world would want to have insight on. This prepared her for The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Due to her ability to read and write before the age of three, when enrolled in school she was often promoted several grades ahead of her age. Oprah at the age of six went to live with her mother, Vernita Lee. Vernita worked as a maid, so Oprah was often left alone at home with her cousins. Oprah due to her busy mother was paid little attention to at home, this is what prompted Oprah to started misbehaving and talking back to her mother. Vernita Lee then decided it was best Oprah live with her father in Nashville Tennessee. Oprah while living in Tennessee, found out her mother was pregnant and her mother requested for her to come back to Milwaukee to live with her mother and half-sister. When Oprah was nine she was raped by her nineteen year old cousin who was baby sitting her. This wouldn't be the only time she was sexually abused she would then be sexually abused by her cousin, a family friend,her mother's boyfriend, and her uncle during her stay in Milwaukee. Toward all these incidents, she never told a soul because the predators swore her to silence. At the age of thirteen Oprah ran away from home, this was due to her years of abuse and at the age of fourteen she became pregnant with an ill son who died shortly after birth. Oprah took the death of her son as she was given a second chance in life. Oprah's mother sent her to live once again with her father in Nashville,Tennessee. Oprah's father was very strict and made education the number-one priority for Oprah.  Oprah attended Nashville East High School. Oprah during high-school wasn't precisely certain toward what she wanted to do, however she knew it was something with speaking or drama. Oprah was also elected school president and met with president Richard Nixon being apart of public speaking classes in her high-school.  Oprah during the last year of high-school was rehearsing with her drama class when a local radio station, WVOL spotted her and asked her if she would like to read on radio. Oprah was then given a job reading the news on the radio. Oprah soon entered into a public speaking contest where the grand prize was a scholarship to Tennessee State University. Oprah won the contest and received a scholarship to Tennessee State University where she majored in Speech Communications and Performing Arts.  Oprah during her college education was offered a job as a co-anchor on the CBS television station, she declined several times before she was convinced by her speech professor that it may be the ultimate step to launch her career. Oprah wanted to find work outside of Nashville Tennessee and was soon offered a job in Baltimore,Maryland. The job offer came up a few months before her graduation, she had to choose between the job and graduating, so she decided to choose the job in Maryland as the offer was very tempting. At the job in Maryland she wasn't a very good reporter and was shortly fired. Oprah's boss set her up as a talk show host on a morning talk show called, "People Are Talking". Immediately after the first show Oprah new this is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. Oprah strengthened the talk show for seven years and then she decided it was time to move on.  In 1981 Oprah sent recorded tapes of the show to a talk-show in Chicago called A.M. Chicago. They immediately offered her the job and in September of 1985 she changed the name of the show to, "The Oprah Winfrey Show". The first broadcast of The Oprah Winfrey Show was on September,8,1986 it broadcasted nationally. The Oprah Winfrey show first targeted woman, however soon due to controversial topics and intriguing topics Oprah brought on to the show it appealed to people of all genders,ethnics,and ages.

          <nom>Mac, Bernie</nom>
          <nom_naissance>McCullough, Bernard Jeffrey</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo' Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who's the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _"Midnight Mac" (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable 'Spike Lee' (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _"Moesha" (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac's star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence's uncle in _What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac's health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Paymer, David Charles</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>One of modern TV and moviedom's most sturdy and reliable character actors, David Paymer dreamed of being an actor from early childhood. Although he came from a traditional middle-class Jewish family that urged him to become a doctor or lawyer, Paymer felt more at home in the world of the thespian. At 14, he used a fake I.D. to see The Graduate, which starred a young Dustin Hoffman. He grew up in Oceanside, New York, where his father was in the scrap metal business. His mother, a homemaker, had fled Belgium with her family to escape the Nazis. When his father quit the scrap metal business to pursue music, it inspired young Paymer to give his acting dream a try. His aborted big break came when he was cast in the TV series, St. Elsewhere, as "Dr. Wayne Fiscus" - then promptly dumped and replaced by Howie Mandel. Luckily, his real big break was destined to be on the big screen, as "Ira Shalowitz" in the Billy Crystal vehicle, City Slickers. Crystal was so pleased with Paymer's work that he wrote the part of "Stan Yankelman", beleaguered brother of the titular character in the movie, Mr. Saturday Night, especially for Paymer. The part earned Paymer an Oscar nomination in 1993.  "That was like getting my passport stamped", said Paymer and he was quickly in demand by directors such as Spielberg ("Amistad"), Redford ("Quiz Show"), Oliver Stone ("Nixon"), David Mamet ("State &amp; Main"), Steven Soderbergh ("Ocean's 13"), and Sam Raimi ("Drag me to Hell"). Chameleon-like in his portrayals, Paymer has since starred in hundreds of roles in film &amp; television, notably "The American President", "Get Shorty", "Payback", "The Hurricane", "In Good Company", Francis Ford Coppola's "Twixt" and Kenneth Branagh's "Jack Ryan: Shadow One".  Paymer received Golden Globe nominations for "Mr. Saturday Night" and for HBO's "Crime of the Century". Paymer became a hyphenate in 2002, directing the acclaimed comedy short "Candor City Hospital" for Showtime. He has since directed over 60 episodes for broadcast television, including such hits as "Grey's Anatomy", "The Mentalist", "Brothers &amp; Sisters", "Medium" &amp; "The Unit". He is also a producer and director on the CW series "Hart of Dixie". Paymer resides in Santa Monica, CA with his wife and two daughters.</biographie>

Born on April 25, 1940, in the Bronx, New York, Pacino's parents (Salvatore and Rose) divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach 'Lee Strasberg' (qv), creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many '70s-era actors. After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, he finally hit it big with "The Indian Wants the Bronx", winning an Obie award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for "Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?". His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a junkie in _The Panic in Needle Park (1971)_ (qv) after his film debut in _Me, Natalie (1969)_ (qv). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv) was one of the most sought-after of the time: 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv), 'Warren Beatty (I)' (qv), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Ryan O'Neal (I)' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv) had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--didn't want him. Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola's) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone's career, including Pacino's, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, however, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama _Serpico (1973)_ (qv) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film _Dog Day Afternoon (1975)_ (qv). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the "Best Actor" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with _Bobby Deerfield (1977)_ (qv), but regained his stride with _...And Justice for All. (1979)_ (qv), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This would, unfortunately, signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as _Cruising (1980)_ (qv) and _Author! Author! (1982)_ (qv). He took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult hit _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. _Revolution (1985)_ (qv) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, _The Local Stigmatic (1990)_ (qv), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv) as a hard-drinking cop. It marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice. Returning to the Corleones, he made _The Godfather: Part III (1990)_ (qv) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful _Dick Tracy (1990)_ (qv). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for _Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)_ (qv). He went into romantic mode for _Frankie and Johnny (1991)_ (qv). In 1992 he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in _Scent of a Woman (1992)_ (qv). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. _Carlito's Way (1993)_ (qv) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama _Heat (1995)_ (qv) directed by 'Michael Mann (I)' (qv) and co-starring 'Robert De Niro' (qv), although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director's chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation _Looking for Richard (1996)_ (qv). _City Hall (1996)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv) and _The Devil's Advocate (1997)_ (qv) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then 'Oliver Stone (I)' (qv), he gave two commanding performances in _The Insider (1999)_ (qv) and _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood's most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend 'Beverly D'Angelo (I)' (qv). His romantic history includes a long-time romance with "Godfather" co-star 'Diane Keaton' (qv). With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies' true legends.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Barkin, Ellen Rona</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Offbeat, unconventionally pretty, and utterly mesmerizing, Ellen Barkin was born in 1954 of Jewish parentage, the daughter of a chemical salesman and hospital administrator. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan's High School of the Performing Arts.  Barkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love - acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York's Actor's Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays "Shout Across the River" (1979), "Extremities" (1983), "Fool for Love" (1984) and "Eden Court" (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in _Diner (1982)_ (qv) opposite 'Mickey Rourke' (qv) and 'Daniel Stern (I)' (qv), and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in _The Big Easy (1986)_ (qv) starring 'Dennis Quaid' (qv) and _Siesta (1987)_ (qv) with Irish actor 'Gabriel Byrne' (qv), whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.  With trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite 'Al Pacino' (qv) in the thriller _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv). In addition, she was well cast as 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s abused wife in _This Boy's Life (1993)_ (qv), and portrayed "Calamity Jane" in _Wild Bill (1995)_ (qv) with earnest. Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)_ (qv), _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv) and _Mercy (2000)_ (qv). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie _Clinton and Nadine (1988) (TV)_ (qv) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in _Before Women Had Wings (1997) (TV)_ (qv) opposite 'Oprah Winfrey' (qv) as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.  In 2000, Barkin married billionaire 'Ronald O. Perelman' (qv), eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like _She Hate Me (2004)_ (qv) and _Palindromes (2004)_ (qv). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.  Just prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother 'George Barkin' (qv), who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive 'Caroline Kaplan (I)' (qv). In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv) with 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Matt Damon' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv) and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean's with a supporting role in 'Antoine Fuqua' (qv)'s _Brooklyn's Finest (2009)_ (qv), _Happy Tears (2009)_ (qv) with 'Parker Posey' (qv) and 'Demi Moore' (qv), and _Twelve (2010)_ (qv).  Recently, Barkin has produced features, including _Letters to Juliet (2010)_ (qv) and _Another Happy Day (2011)_ (qv) (she also starred in the latter project). On the small screen, she appeared in an episode of _"Modern Family" (2009)_ (qv) and her new NBC show, _"The New Normal" (2012)_ (qv), got a sneak peek during the Olympics.  She lives with her two teenage children in Manhattan.</biographie>

Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.  Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats.

          <nom_naissance>Damon, Matthew Paige</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to 'Kent Damon' (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and 'Nancy Carlsson-Paige' (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5'10" star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with 'Ben Affleck' (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with 'Tom Hanks' (qv) and 'Vin Diesel' (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite 'Edward Norton (I)' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, 'Ben Affleck' (qv) and fellow comedian, 'Chris Rock (I)' (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played "Tom Ripley", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both 'Jude Law' (qv) and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Will Smith (I)' (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers' _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Casey Affleck' (qv).  One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the "Bourne" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, "Jason Bourne", in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as "Linus Caldwell" in the "Ocean's" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Don Cheadle' (qv) in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in 'Terry Gilliam' (qv)'s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv)'s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born 'Luciana Barroso' (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Brad Pitt' (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), together with Ben's wife, 'Jennifer Garner (I)' (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife, 'Luciana Barroso' (qv).</biographie>

          <nom>Caan, Scott</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Caan, Scott Andrew</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a "man's-man" like his father, legendary actor 'James Caan (I)' (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent's homes. His mom is actress and model 'Sheila Ryan (II)' (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father's hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son's little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend 'The Alchemist' (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and 'Gregg Araki' (qv)'s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director 'Tony Scott (I)' (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott's star rose with a fun supporting turn in 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv)'s _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - 'Nicolas Cage' (qv)'s directorial debut starring 'James Franco' (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan's return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _"Entourage" (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _"Hawaii Five-0" (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer 'Phil Parmet' (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biographie>

      <titre>GoldenEye</titre>
      <synopsis>1986 - Soviet Russia has been arming international terrorists with chemical weapon technology, and a chemical weapons plant in the mountains is the target of James Bond and his closest compatriot, Alec Trevelyan. Infiltrating the compound, they are spotted and Alec is captured. When a ruthless Soviet officer, Oromov, executes Trevelyan, James pulls off a spectacular escape and succeeds in blowing up the compound. Now in 1995, he is assigned to tail former Red Air Force jet jockey Xenia Onatopp, who is working for a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus, but he is unable to stop her from stealing a powerful helicopter - a theft initially dismissed as a possibility by MI6's new leader, a woman who is a bureaucratic bean counter who, despite her acidic responses to grumbling from her ticked-off men, is having to learn her job as she goes, and who has to trust James Bond's instincts after a nuclear accident occurs over a Russian region housing the tracking station for a weapons satellite known as Goldeneye. James must track down the stolen gunship and all leads to a second Goldeneye system, and along the way he is horrified to find the true identity of the Janus syndicate, which leads to a spectacular running pursuit from the stolen gunship through a Soviet army prison to a wild street chase involving a tank and confrontation with a Soviet missile train, and eventually a showdown in the jungles of Cuba.</synopsis>

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Actor Simon Kunz was born on 8 May 1954, the same year that his American-born, England domiciled grandfather, the pianist Charlie Kunz, had a Top Twenty hit with Piano Medley 114. After leaving the Latymer School Simon read Theatre Studies at Warwick University and in 1984 became the drummer in the band the Locomotives. However, rather than follow Charlie into the music business he left the group after a year to concentrate on acting. On stage he appeared with the National Theatre (Brackenbury in 'Richard III'), the Oxford Stage Company (Oliver in 'As You Like It', Edgar in 'King Lear')in 'The Caretaker' at the Bristol Old Vic, 'Live Like Pigs' at the Royal Court and 'The Park' with the Royal Shakespeare Company, making his film debut in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. On television he has appeared in most of the populist dramas where he seems to have played rather more than his fair share of policemen - of all ranks - and lawyers.</biographie>

          <biographie>Pierce Brosnan was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and lived in Navan, County Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability to play men from both backgrounds convincingly). His father left the household when Pierce was a child and although reunited later in life, the two have never had a close relationship. His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and Sean from their marriage.

          <nom>Cumming, Alan</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan's dad took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 'O' Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, "Tops", and was also the "Young Alan" who answered readers' letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student 'Forbes Masson' (qv) called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records ("Hear Victor and Barry and Faint", "Are We Too Loud?") and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in "Macbeth" at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in 'Gillies MacKinnon' (qv)'s "Passing Glory". After graduating Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _"Take the High Road" (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when "Conquest of the South Pole", a play by German playwright 'Manfred Karge' (qv), transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988.  Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in "Accidental Death of an Anarchist", which he also adapted with director 'Tim Supple' (qv). The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with 'Ian Sellar (I)' (qv)'s _Prague (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with 'Sandrine Bonnaire' (qv) and 'Bruno Ganz' (qv). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - _"Screen Two" (1985) {The Last Romantics (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for "La Bete". In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim ("An actor knocking on the door of greatness" - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in "Cabaret"--in the Daily Telegraph's performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in 'Sam Mendes (I)' (qv)' revival of "Cabaret" at the same venue (London's Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for "Cabaret", and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination.  In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)_ (qv) and _Buddy (1997)_ (qv). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv) and the 'Spice Girls' (qv) before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in "Cabaret" on Broadway.

Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001's "Design for Living" on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway "Elle" by 'Jean Genet' (qv), which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. Films have included 'Julie Taymor' (qv)'s _Titus (1999)_ (qv), _Urbania (2000)_ (qv), the "Spy Kids" trilogy, _Josie and the Pussycats (2001)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _Nicholas Nickleby (2002)_ (qv), _Son of the Mask (2005)_ (qv) and the Showtime movie musical _Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) (TV)_ (qv). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in _The Anniversary Party (2001)_ (qv) with 'Jennifer Jason Leigh' (qv), which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films _Sweet Land (2005)_ (qv) and _Full Grown Men (2006)_ (qv) (and appears in both) and acted in _Gray Matters (2006/I)_ (qv) opposite 'Heather Graham (I)' (qv) and _Bam Bam and Celeste (2005)_ (qv) opposite 'Margaret Cho' (qv). in 2006 he will return to Broadway as Macheath in "The Threepenny Opera".

          <nom>Llewelyn, Desmond</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Llewelyn, Desmond Wilkinson</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago."</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Bean, Shaun Mark</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Sean Bean, England's most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in "Clarissa," passionate lovers like Mellors in "Lady Chatterley's Lover," rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in "The Lord of the Rings," and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in "Troy," where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's "Macbeth," where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, "I don't have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of 'rough'. Why would I?" Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.</biographie>

          <biographie>Born in the northern Polish town of Bialystok, 'Izabella Scorupco' (qv) moved to Sweden with her mother as a young child. She studied drama and music and, at 17, was discovered by a Swedish film director who cast her in the movie _Ingen kan älska som vi (1988)_ (qv), which made her a local teenage idol. She then became a successful model in Sweden and throughout Europe, where she made good use of her fluency in four languages.  In 1989, Scorupco displayed another facet of her talents, launching her career as a pop singer with her first single, Substitute. The single and subsequent album, IZA, both went gold, and she followed with another hit single, Shame, Shame, which she recorded in 1991. Returning to acting in 1994, she immediately won the lead role in the Swedish film _Petri tårar (1995)_ (qv). Scorupco stars as a woman who lives her life as a man in the medieval drama, which was released in August 1995.</biographie>

          <biographie>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen's younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel's bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker's next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _"Eischied" (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biographie>

          <nom>Coltrane, Robbie</nom>
          <nom_naissance>McMillan, Anthony Robert</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director 'Amos Poe' (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biographie>

      <synopsis>After successfully stealing 160 million from ruthless casino owner Terry Benedict, Danny Ocean and his 10 cohorts think they're free and clear. But one day Terry Benedict pays each of them a visit but instead of doing something to them, he tells them they have 2 weeks. When they get together they deduce that Benedict wants them to pay him back what they took with interest. Knowing they can't do a job in the U.S. they decide to go to Europe.

When they try to pull the job they were given, they discover that someone else has pulled the job. They deduce he was the one who told Benedict who they are. Later Europol operative Isabel Lahiri investigates and upon seeing how they tried to do it, shows up at their door. It seems she and Rusty "know" each other, and he's been following her. While she chooses not to arrest them, she warns them not to do anything. She also tells them who the man is who told Benedict. When they find him, they learn that he feels offended that his mentor who is a great thief thinks they're better than him so he challenges them to steal something and if they do he'll give them the money they need to pay Benedict.

          <nom>Reiner, Carl</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his "10,000 Year Old Man" album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his "angels" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _"The Fashion Story" (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _"The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue" (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical "Inside U.S.A.", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, "Alive and Kicking", was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _"Your Show of Shows" (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing "The Professor", a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, "Your Show of Shows" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _"Caesar's Hour" (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  "Your Show or Shows" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas "Caesar's Hour" was pure comedy. "Your Show of Shows" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to "Caesar's Hour". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during "Your Show of Shows", but he began writing formally for "Caesar's Hour", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited "writer without portfolio", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, "Man of the House", in which he would play a writer, "Rob Petrie", who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a "benign despot" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv), and their routine "The 2000 Year Old Man" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down "Man of the House", with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of "Rob Petrie" to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of "Alan Brady", the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of "Alan Brady" on _"Mad About You" (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _"The Cleveland Show" (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his "Your Show of Shows" experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _"Hot in Cleveland" (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _"Parks and Recreation" (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biographie>

          <nom>Affleck, Casey</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Affleck, Caleb Casey</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of 'Ben Affleck' (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor's degree.  Affleck's first major film role was in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) and 'Nicole Kidman' (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which 'Ben Affleck' (qv) co-wrote with 'Matt Damon' (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Matt Damon' (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean's Eleven's ensemble cast. Affleck's character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) in the "hoax-umentary" _I'm Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married 'Summer Phoenix' (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Eurasian with dual french and Vietnamese origins, Anne-Solenne Hatte was first discovered by French photographer Jean Baptiste Huynh, whose photos of her attracted her first agent. She appears in advertising for Cartier, Biotherm, Levis, and enrolled in Paris V and the Sorbonne University while she still worked as an actress and model. Her career began with the channel Canal +, which opened the gate for television. With the success of the concept of JT Decale, Anne-Solenne became the new face and anchor, of iTele's daily show. In charge of programming for a year, Anne-Solenne was inspired by alternative videos on the web and press pictures, and chose interesting guests such as Erik Orsenna, Claude Sarraute for Women's day. Although the show's a success and she greatly enjoys journalism, Anne-Solenne is determined to pursue her long-standing passion for acting. She captures Steven Soderbergh's attention and made her big-screen debut on Ocean 12. Then she attended the prestigious Drama School of Jean-Laurent Cochet in Paris for three years. Jean-Laurent Cochet directed her on stage as Eurydice - the main part in the eponymous play - and as Gwendoline in Becket, both by french author Jean Anouilh. She also stared in the 2010 Folie Theatre production of Talking with Angels, the true story of Gitta Mallasz, in Paris. In 2012 she played Juliet in a new production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet directed by Baptiste Belleudy, in Paris. In 2012 she appeared in the beginning of Lock Out before her character was killed. The film is directed by James Mathers and Stephen St. Leger. Release April 2012.</biographie>

          <biographie>Born in Lexington, Kentucky, as son of 'Nick Clooney' (qv), a TV newscaster of many years, who hosted a talk show at Cincinnati and often invited George into the studios already at the age of 5. Avoiding competition with his father, he quit his job as broadcast journalist after a short time.  George studied for a few years at Northern Kentucky University. He failed to join the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He came to acting when his cousin, 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv), got him a small part in a feature film. After that, in 1982, he moved to Los Angeles and tried for a whole year to get a role while he slept in a friend's closet. His first movie, together with 'Charlie Sheen' (qv), stayed unreleased but got him the producers' attention for later contracts.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Jones, Catherine</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Catherine Zeta-Jones was born on September 25, 1969 in Swansea, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK, the daughter of Dai Jones, who formerly owned a candy factory, and Pat Jones. Her brother David Jones (b. 1967) is a development executive and brother Lyndon Jones (b. 1972) works at her production company. Catherine showed an interest early on in entertainment. She starred on stage in "Annie", "Bugsy Malone" and "The Pajama Game". At age 15, she had the lead in the British revival of "42nd Street". She was originally cast as the second understudy for the lead role in the musical but when the star and first understudy became sick the night the play's producer was in the audience, she was given the lead for the rest of the musical's production. She first made a name for herself in the early 1990s when she starred in the Yorkshire Television comedy/drama series _"The Darling Buds of May" (1991)_ (qv). The series was a smash hit and made her one of the United Kingdom's most popular television actresses. She subsequently played supporting roles in several films including _Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992)_ (qv), the miniseries _Catherine the Great (1996) (TV)_ (qv) and a larger part as the seductive Sala in _The Phantom (1996)_ (qv) before landing her breakthrough role playing the fiery Elena opposite 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) and 'Antonio Banderas' (qv) in _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv). She starred in many big-budget blockbusters like _Entrapment (1999)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv), for which many believed she was robbed of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. In November 2000, she married actor 'Michael Douglas (I)' (qv). She gave birth to their son Dylan Michael in August 2000 followed by daughter, Carys, in April 2003. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her accomplishments in film and television.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Crochon, Vincent</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Blue-eyed Vincent Cassel was born in Paris to a leading French actor father, 'Jean-Pierre Cassel' (qv) and a journalist mother. Often labeled as a tough guy because of his roles, eclectic choices and talent have made of him a star of European cinema. First in _La haine (1995)_ (qv), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside 'Jean Reno (I)' (qv), made of him "the man to count on." He never hid his taste for rap music, break dance, Capoeira, Brasil and his endless energy, but Vincent is also a family man, married to 'Monica Bellucci' (qv), his Italian co-star from _L'appartement (1996)_ (qv) (aka The Apartment); and recently a father.</biographie>

          <nom>Mac, Bernie</nom>
          <nom_naissance>McCullough, Bernard Jeffrey</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo' Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who's the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _"Midnight Mac" (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable 'Spike Lee' (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _"Moesha" (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac's star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence's uncle in _What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac's health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biographie>

          <biographie>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, 'Eric Roberts (I)' (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia's biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People's Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biographie>

Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.  Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats. He eventually came to the United States where he trains in Los Angeles for the company's international tours.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Damon, Matthew Paige</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to 'Kent Damon' (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and 'Nancy Carlsson-Paige' (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5'10" star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with 'Ben Affleck' (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with 'Tom Hanks' (qv) and 'Vin Diesel' (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite 'Edward Norton (I)' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, 'Ben Affleck' (qv) and fellow comedian, 'Chris Rock (I)' (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played "Tom Ripley", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both 'Jude Law' (qv) and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Will Smith (I)' (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers' _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Casey Affleck' (qv).  One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the "Bourne" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, "Jason Bourne", in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as "Linus Caldwell" in the "Ocean's" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Don Cheadle' (qv) in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in 'Terry Gilliam' (qv)'s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv)'s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born 'Luciana Barroso' (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Brad Pitt' (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), together with Ben's wife, 'Jennifer Garner (I)' (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife, 'Luciana Barroso' (qv).</biographie>

          <nom>Coltrane, Robbie</nom>
          <nom_naissance>McMillan, Anthony Robert</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director 'Amos Poe' (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biographie>

          <nom>Caan, Scott</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Caan, Scott Andrew</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a "man's-man" like his father, legendary actor 'James Caan (I)' (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent's homes. His mom is actress and model 'Sheila Ryan (II)' (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father's hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son's little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend 'The Alchemist' (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and 'Gregg Araki' (qv)'s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director 'Tony Scott (I)' (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott's star rose with a fun supporting turn in 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv)'s _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - 'Nicolas Cage' (qv)'s directorial debut starring 'James Franco' (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan's return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _"Entourage" (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _"Hawaii Five-0" (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer 'Phil Parmet' (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biographie>

      <titre>Casino Royale</titre>
      <synopsis>Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession, he is elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Uganda where he is to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides to investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter who is representing the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.</synopsis>

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Malcolm Sinclair read drama and theology at the University of Hull and then went on to do a one year post-graduate acting course at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. After seven years in different repertory companies around the country he made his London debut in 1985 at the Notting Hill Gate Theatre in Arthur Schnitzler's play 'Anatole', which he describes as the first thing that got him noticed. Since then he has appeared with both the National and Royal Shakespeare companies and has taken on musical roles in the likes of 'Privates On Parade' and 'My Fair lady'. On television he has been bumped off several times in who-dunnit mystery dramas though he stayed the course as supercilious Assistant Chief Constable Freddie Fisher in 'Pie In the Sky'. In July 2010 he was elected the president of the Equity actors' union.</biographie>

          <nom>Giannini, Giancarlo</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Giancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.  He was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For ten years young Giannini lived and studied in Naples, earning his degree in electronics. At the age of 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D'Amico in Rome, making his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays, as well, as in Italian productions of 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s plays "Romeo and Juliet" and "A Midsummer's Night Dream". In 1965 he made his debut on television starring as David Copperfield in the TV mini-series made by RAI, the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in _Libido (1965)_ (qv), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with the legendary Italian director 'Lina Wertmüller' (qv), who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator 'Benito Mussolini' (qv) in _Film d'amore e d'anarchia, ovvero 'stamattina alle 10 in via dei Fiori nella nota casa di tolleranza...' (1973)_ (qv), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy _Travolti da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto (1974)_ (qv) and as a survivor of a concentration camp in the Oscar-nominated _Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975)_ (qv). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in 'Rainer Werner Fassbinder' (qv)'s masterpiece _Lili Marleen (1981)_ (qv).  Giannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), 'Al Pacino' (qv), 'Michael Douglas (I)' (qv), 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv), 'Gérard Depardieu' (qv) and 'Ian McKellen' (qv), among others. He received a compliment from 'Stanley Kubrick' for his dubbing of Nicholson in _The Shining (1980)_ (qv). Giannini's fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as _A Walk in the Clouds (1995)_ (qv), _Hannibal (2001)_ (qv), _Darkness (2002)_ (qv) and _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), and reprises the role in the sequel, _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv).</biographie>

          <biographie>Born in Toronto of American and British parents, Peter lives and works internationally.

Appearing in such films as Casino Royale and The Dark Knight, he also plays hippie activist Jerry Rubin in the upcoming Warner Brothers movie Hippie Hippie Shake opposite Cillian Murphy and Sienna Miller. In addition, he is the crazed DJ Phoenix Fox in the upcoming video game Forza Horizon.

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Lasco Atkins was born in Hong Kong in 1980. At an early age he already knew he loved films, mainly action movies starring Arnie, Sly, JCVD, etc. Once at film school he learned a new appreciation for classics, black &amp; whites, 70s, etc. He re-watched old films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces. He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP's since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</biographie>

          <nom>Craig, Daniel</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Craig, Daniel Wroughton</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as "James Bond" in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of "Ring O' Bells" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of "Oliver!", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in "Oliver", "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cinderella" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as "Agamemnon" in Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes' (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named 'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _"Our Friends in the North" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray "James Bond", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of 'Steven Spielberg' (qv).  Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool "007". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as "Bond".</biographie>

          <nom>Green, Eva</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Green, Eva Gaëlle</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, 'Marlène Jobert' (qv), is an actress who retired from acting and became a writer of children's books. Eva's mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva's father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University.  She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: "La Jalousie en Trois Fax" and "Turcaret". There she caught the eye of director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). During their work Bertolucci described Green as being "so beautiful it's indecent." Green won critical acclaim for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score.  After The Dreamers Green's career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite 'Romain Duris' (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite 'Orlando Bloom' (qv) and 'Liam Neeson' (qv) in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by 'Ridley Scott' (qv). The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia that went to 'Hilary Swank' (qv) because she didn't want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl after 'Claudine Auger' (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), 'Corinne Cléry (I)' (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), 'Carole Bouquet' (qv) in _For Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and 'Sophie Marceau' (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).  Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can't speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</biographie>

          <nom>Wright, Jeffrey</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation, Jeffrey Wright's undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business. Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents: a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known in fact as "the hospital murderer". In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation of stories of one's line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</biographie>

Her mother was arrested, and Vera and her sisters spent the rest of the war in Gestapo camps. They were reunited with their mother after the war, but the family was destitute, and ostracised by other Germans for their father's treachery. She ended up studying textile design in Florence, where a fashion designer first asked her to model.

          <biographie>Pierce Brosnan was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and lived in Navan, County Meath, until he moved to England, UK, at an early age (thus explaining his ability to play men from both backgrounds convincingly).

His most popular role is that of British secret agent James Bond. The death, in 1991, of 'Cassandra Harris (I)' (qv), his wife of eleven years, left him with three children - Christopher and Charlotte from Cassandra's first marriage and Sean from their marriage. Since her death, he has had two children with his second wife, 'Keely Shaye Smith' (qv).</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Price, Clifford Joseph</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Known throughout the music industry as the "king of jungle", Goldie is an artist whose ferocious creativity knows no bounds. Born and bred on the breakdancing and hip-hop culture he absorbed during trips to the States in his youth, Goldie was a graffitti artist and an album cover artist before receiving the backing to record his first track, "Terminator", in 1993. His debut album, "Timeless", followed two years later, and was hailed by critics as a masterpiece. The album fused the hypersyncopated breakbeats and reggae chic common in jungle music with a provocative bassline and soulful diva vocals. That album's title track, a 21-minute symphonic piece, was a masterstroke, and the lively "Inner City Life" was a smash. With his reputation firmly established, he released his sophomore album in 1998, Saturnzreturn. The album's opening track, "Mother" a 60-minute orchestral/drum-n-bass piece, is a haunting track and serves as the companion piece to "Timeless." The remainder of the album, featuring cameos by 'David Bowie' (qv), 'Noel Gallagher (II)' (qv) of 'Oasis (I)' (qv), and rapper 'KRS-One' (qv), is a mishmash of Goldie's signature sound. Critics were not impressed with this follow-up effort, however; many lambasted the album as too "self-indulgent". Nonetheless, no one can deny that Goldie is an artist who will continue to amaze his fans and the industry with his epic scope and syncopated vision.</biographie>

          <nom>Llewelyn, Desmond</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Llewelyn, Desmond Wilkinson</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school's productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department's physical exam. "Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn't take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test." After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry "was definitely not for me." Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn's company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that "eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there," and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called "a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice." After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers 'Harry Saltzman' (qv) and 'Albert R. Broccoli' (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he "was quite disappointed" at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. "I'd love to be in the next one," Llewelyn said. "Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago."</biographie>

Naturally exuding wisdom and talent, David Calder often appears as just that: wise, scholarly old gentleman in almost any film or television appearance he makes. Undoubtedly an accomplished and easily-recognizable face to British audiences, however David perhaps is better known to American audiences with his appearances in high profile movies such as the James Bond spy-action film The World Is Not Enough (1999) as Sir Robert King, the on-screen father of Sophie Marceau; and then in the Mummy trilogy subtitled Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008).</biographie>

          <nom>Cleese, John</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Cleese, John Marwood</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>John Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, in Weston-Super-Mare, England. He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, "The Goon Show," starring the legendary 'Peter Sellers (I)' (qv), 'Spike Milligan' (qv), and 'Harry Secombe' (qv).  Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university's legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python 'Graham Chapman' (qv). Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name "Cambridge Circus." When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met 'Terry Gilliam' (qv), another future Python.  Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, "I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again", based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies 'Tim Brooke-Taylor' (qv), 'Bill Oddie' (qv) and 'Graeme Garden' (qv). He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, 'Graham Chapman' (qv) and 'Marty Feldman' (qv) in _"At Last the 1948 Show" (1967)_ (qv), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - 'Eric Idle' (qv), 'Terry Gilliam' (qv), 'Terry Jones (I)' (qv), 'Michael Palin' (qv), and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included _"The Frost Report" (1966)_ (qv) and 'Marty Feldman' (qv)'s program _"Marty" (1968)_ (qv). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, _"Monty Python's Flying Circus" (1969)_ (qv), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.  After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - _Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)_ (qv), _Life of Brian (1979)_ (qv), _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982)_ (qv), and _The Meaning of Life (1983)_ (qv). Cleese and then-wife 'Connie Booth (I)' (qv) collaborated in the legendary television series _"Fawlty Towers" (1975)_ (qv), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.  Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy _A Fish Called Wanda (1988)_ (qv), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.  Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese's other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with 'Connie Booth (I)' (qv) and a daughter with his second wife, 'Barbara Trentham' (qv). As of January 19, 2008, he became embroiled in divorce proceedings with third wife (of nineteen years) 'Alyce Faye Eichelberger' (qv).  Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.</biographie>

          <nom>Coltrane, Robbie</nom>
          <nom_naissance>McMillan, Anthony Robert</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain's most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the "Harry Potter" franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad's books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from "Henry V". At that time he was fascinated with 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Orson Welles' (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh's Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled "Young Mental Health", which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh's renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as "Border Guard" in BBC's mini-series _"The Lost Tribe" (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director 'Amos Poe' (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _"Alfresco" (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane's barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie "Fitz" Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _"Cracker" (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by 'J.K. Rowling' (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, "Coltrane in a Cadillac", and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _"Coltrane in a Cadillac" (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biographie>

      <synopsis>When Daniel Ocean is released from prison in New Jersey, his next heist is already planned. Danny's target are three Las Vegas casinos: The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. They all belong to ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict, who, by the way, also shows a certain interest in Danny's beautiful ex-wife Tess. During a much-anticipated boxing event (Lennox Lewis vs. Wladimir Klitschko), there will be $150 million in the safe, 70 yards below the strip. So, Danny starts to hire professionals from all over the country: There's the card magician Rusty Ryan, the perfect pickpocket Linus Caldwell and the ingenious pyrotechnician Basher Tarr. Reuben Tishkoff, who lost a casino to Benedict, provides funding, the brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy will drive and help, and Frank Catton, a professional card dealer, gets a job at the casino to watch the routines. Saul Bloom, already retired, will play the rich heavy weaponry dealer and live in the hotel, while Livingston Dell bugs the place to have a look over the shoulders of the security personnel. Finally, the chinese acrobat artist Yen will be the one to move inside the safe before the motion detectors are turned off. There are three rules to be followed: First: no blood. Second: Rob only who deserves it. Third: Do it as if you have nothing to lose. When the day of the boxing event finally draws near, all is set, and Benedict doesn't have a clue - or does he?</synopsis>

          <nom>Reiner, Carl</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his "10,000 Year Old Man" album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his "angels" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _"The Fashion Story" (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _"The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue" (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical "Inside U.S.A.", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, "Alive and Kicking", was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _"Your Show of Shows" (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing "The Professor", a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, "Your Show of Shows" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _"Caesar's Hour" (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  "Your Show or Shows" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas "Caesar's Hour" was pure comedy. "Your Show of Shows" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to "Caesar's Hour". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during "Your Show of Shows", but he began writing formally for "Caesar's Hour", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited "writer without portfolio", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, "Man of the House", in which he would play a writer, "Rob Petrie", who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a "benign despot" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _"The Steve Allen Show" (1956)_ (qv), and their routine "The 2000 Year Old Man" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down "Man of the House", with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of "Rob Petrie" to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of "Alan Brady", the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _"The Dick Van Dyke Show" (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of "Alan Brady" on _"Mad About You" (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on "The Dick Van Dyke Show" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _"The Cleveland Show" (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his "Your Show of Shows" experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _"Hot in Cleveland" (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _"Parks and Recreation" (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Manoux, Jean-Paul Christophe</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>J.P. Manoux grew up on the beaches of Santa Barbara, California, the oldest of seven. He was involved in children's theatre productions and took tap dance lessons before attending the Thacher School in Ojai, California. Curiously, that tiny boarding school would provide no less than 3 doctors for NBC's long running hospital drama ER (Noah Wyle and Leland Orser, the other two). As college applications approached, Manoux's drama teacher recommended the undergraduate theatre department at Northwestern University.  Surrounded by Chicago's vibrant theatre scene, J.P. became passionate about improv and sketch comedy. Upon graduating and moving to Hollywood, he sharpened his own comedy chops at L.A. Theatresports, ACME Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings School, and I.O. West. Legit stage productions garnered critical accolades, culminating in 1999 with L.A. Ovation and Backstage West Garland Awards recognizing his work in the world premiere stage musical Reefer Madness.  Over the next few years, J.P. appeared in dozens of TV sitcoms and national commercials including campaigns for Got Milk? and Fruit of the Loom. He was a regular improviser and sketch player on ABC's 2001 prime-time variety experiment The Wayne Brady Show and he became a celebrity in the world of children's television thanks to his dual role as "Mr. Hackett" and "Curtis the Caveman" on the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. During this period, he also voiced the lead role of "Kuzco" in Disney's animated series The Emperor's New School. In 2006, J.P. joined the ensemble of ER, recurring as surgical resident Dustin Crenshaw. It would prove to be a shrewd casting move, widely regarded (in the Manoux household) as the single most significant factor in returning the venerable series to its original acclaim, prestige, and sex appeal.  Opportunities to act and direct in Canada led Manoux to pursue immigration north of the border. The Toronto based productions of DisneyXD's sci-fi/adventure series Aaron Stone and Teletoon's hybrid animation comedy series Mud pit saw him working both in front of and behind the camera. Still a U.S. citizen, but now a permanent resident of Canada, Manoux routinely hops the border for film and television work, including his recurring role on Community as "The Deanelganger". He hopes to continue spending summers in Toronto, acting in the new CTV multi-camera sitcom Spun Out which stars Dave Foley of The Kids in the Hall and Newsradio fame.  J.P. Manoux has appeared in over 30 feature films, 90 different television series, and 90 commercials. He has provided voice and motion capture performance for 8 video games, competed as a contestant or celebrity panelist on 6 gameshows, read 2 original pieces for All Things Condsidered on National Public Radio, co-written 1 play, and anonymously authored 1 biography.</biographie>

          <nom>Silva, Henry</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged 'Michael V. Gazzo' (qv)'s play "A Hatful of Rain" as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students 'Ben Gazzara (I)' (qv), 'Shelley Winters' (qv), 'Harry Guardino' (qv), 'Anthony Franciosa (I)' (qv) and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including _The Bravados (1958)_ (qv), _Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv), _Ocean's Eleven (1960)_ (qv), _The Manchurian Candidate (1962)_ (qv) and _Johnny Cool (1963)_ (qv).  An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, _Un fiume di dollari (1966)_ (qv), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted 'Charles Bronson (I)' (qv) to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in the film _Contract on Cherry Street (1977) (TV)_ (qv), then signed on as Buck Rogers' evil adversary Kane in _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe's production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day "to keep in shape and relieve tension".</biographie>

          <nom>Affleck, Casey</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Affleck, Caleb Casey</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of 'Ben Affleck' (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _"The Kennedys of Massachusetts" (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor's degree.  Affleck's first major film role was in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) and 'Nicole Kidman' (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which 'Ben Affleck' (qv) co-wrote with 'Matt Damon' (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Matt Damon' (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean's Eleven's ensemble cast. Affleck's character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed 'Joaquin Phoenix' (qv) in the "hoax-umentary" _I'm Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married 'Summer Phoenix' (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biographie>

          <biographie>Born in Lexington, Kentucky, as son of 'Nick Clooney' (qv), a TV newscaster of many years, who hosted a talk show at Cincinnati and often invited George into the studios already at the age of 5. Avoiding competition with his father, he quit his job as broadcast journalist after a short time.  George studied for a few years at Northern Kentucky University. He failed to join the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He came to acting when his cousin, 'Miguel Ferrer (I)' (qv), got him a small part in a feature film. After that, in 1982, he moved to Los Angeles and tried for a whole year to get a role while he slept in a friend's closet. His first movie, together with 'Charlie Sheen' (qv), stayed unreleased but got him the producers' attention for later contracts.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Scott's acting career began when he was contacted by Carl Butto of Creative Talent in Las Vegas. Carl had seen him on a talk show, representing Nevada Highway Patrol, on the local PBS TV station and was impressed by his voice and screen presence. After appearing in dozens of local commercials, Scott landed the part of "State Trooper" on the WB TV series "The Strip", his first SAG part, and later joked with Carl saying, "If didn't get that part, I shouldn't be acting". He was catching the eyes of prominent Vegas casting directors, most notably, Ray Favaro and Merilee Lear and movie auditions began to come his way. Steven Soderbergh personally thanked Scott for making the Ocean's Eleven Airport Scene spectacular. As an honorably retired State Trooper, Scott gives law enforcement roles added realism and performs them flawlessly. He is sure, the best is yet to come!</biographie>

          <biographie>Eydie Gorme was born in New York on August 16, 1928 to Sephardic Jewish parents. Her father, Nessim Garmezano, was a tailor, from Sicily, who changed his last name when he arrived in the United States. Gorme began singing straight out of high school, with various big bands. But her big break came after she auditioned for, and joined, "The _"Tonight!" (1953)_ (qv) Show" in 1953. There, for $90 a week, she sang solos and sang duets with the up-and-coming 'Steve Lawrence (I)' (qv). The two performed on the show for five years, and married in 1957. After their "Tonight Show" stint, the pair had a short-lived TV show of their own, _"The Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gorme Show" (1958)_ (qv). Then, Lawrence entered the Army leaving Gorme, a new mother, to frequent the night club circuit on her own. Two years later, when Lawrence was discharged, the couple came to a decision to enter show business more professionally. Their career took off, with audiences drawn to their penchant for the classics in favor of rock 'n' roll, as well as their spontaneous banter.</biographie>

          <nom>Stenson, Gregory</nom>
          <nom_naissance />
          <biographie>Gregory Stenson grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today we know him as the 6 foot box-office hero, but his growth spurt didn't occur to late in his teen years, thus his small size made him a target for bullies. The brutalities he endured as a youngster only made him stronger however and has helped to make him the person he is today. Greg has two loving parents and did the best they could with their lower class status. Gregory hated that his family didn't have all the things they would like to, things they saw while watching programs like The Jefferson's and Goodtimes. He wished his family could have such luxuries and live like these TV families did. His major goal in life became to do the best he could to make his families life the best it could possibly be!  His grades in school were never the best, and Gregory couldn't see himself as a suit anyway, so Gregory looked to other avenues to achieve his goal. It was about this time that his body caught up with and surpassed the size of his classmates, and it wasn't long before the coach of his High School Football Team noticed Gregory on campus. Greg took to Football like a fish to water and excelled greatly, his skills as a Line Backer helped drive his team to two State Championship wins. By his senior year Greg was a hot commodity and had scouts from colleges all over the country looking him over. Greg took his time deciding on who he should go with and finally decided on Antelope Valley College in beautiful Lancaster, California and the outstanding Marauders Football Team. While an odd choice it was nonetheless the one that Gregory made. His reasoning better to be a big fish in a small pond than a big fish in a much larger pond! His talents as a Line Backer once again proved strong here as they did in High School. He brought many victories to his team the Marauders through his tenure with them and was on the Fast Track to an NFL Career when tragedy struck in one the most prolific games of his college career. During the third down as the Quarter Back was looking for a clear Receiver and a shot to bring the team to victory, Gregory was holding the line with all he had. He had already held off to heavy blitzes on his QB but the last push was too much and he was overrun by two Rushers and was left lying on the ground after the play was through. Gregory didn't get up and his teammates ran to his side, where they found him screaming in agony.  Gregory was rushed to the local hospital where it was found that his Bicep muscle was entirely ripped from his bone. A terrible injury to have and one that took many months of reconstructive surgery and therapy to correct. Unfortunately this spelled the end of Gregory's football career as the doctor told him one more injury like this and they don't know what would happen!  Greg became disillusioned with life and fell into a very dark period in his life, (little is known about this part of his life?) but re-emerged a year later with new determination and with his original goal of a better life for himself and his family at the forefront once more. Gregory had endless nights without sleep trying to figure out how he could make his dream come true, then it hit him like a blitz from a forward in his football days. While thinking about the TV shows he loved so much as a kid, he thought he could play those parts as good if not better than say J.J. did on Goodtimes. So with a new resolve he decided to be an actor.  Just as Gregory had chosen an obscure approach to his Football College Career, he again chose the same method on his way to his Hollywood Movie Actor Career. Gregory didn't head to Los Angeles or New York as most people do, instead he went to back to Sin City itself, Las Vegas. He knew that more and more movies were being shot there and decided that a big fish in a smaller pond was good enough for him this time as well. He signed with many different agencies as soon as he arrived back in Vegas and not surprisingly was given a very warm reception. His good looks and boyish charm did very well for Gregory indeed. As his agents looked for work for him, sometimes staying up very late to make sure Gregory was looked at seriously for some of the bigger roles, Gregory knew he couldn't just wait for that "right" acting role to come along so he branched off to "character acting."  His agents found him work at The Aladdin Casino playing a Genie. Greg enjoyed this work immensely, he loved it when the tourists would smile at him and ask for a photo with him, he thought to himself, "Well if this is what its like to be a big-time movie actor, I think I'm gonna love it." While playing the Genie he continually went out on auditions, sometimes he would miss some of his work playing Genie, but his producers understood his need to move his career along and gave him time off as needed. While he had not won any parts on the screen or TV yet, he continually tried, knocking down many barriers as he tried. After a year of playing Genie he thought he had explored all the realms of the character so he decided he needed something fresh as it wasn't fair to him or "Genie" to keep playing a character he saw as "evolved". So without another job to go to he bid the Aladdin farewell.  But it wasn't long before Caesar's Palace heard Gregory was available and immediately made an offer to him to play "Marc Anthony" at their casino. Gregory couldn't believe his luck, the role of Marc Anthony was one of the most sought-after roles in Vegas. Here he was being offered the role without even an audition! Gregory loved his new role and explored all facets of the character in his day to day workings.  Greg's movie career also got a shot in the arm at this time as well. One of his agents found him a very small role in the comedy hit "Bubble Boy". Greg played of all things a security guard in this picture, having never had any experience as a security guard in real life, he learned all he could about his role, going as far as doing temp work as one, before filming started to get an idea of what the character should be about. When the time came to shoot Gregory was more than ready, and brought to the part more that even the writer had hoped to see. Gregory was on his way!  While he continued his Marc Anthony role he went for more and more auditions, picking up a commercial or music video starring role along the way. Gregory's biggest break came when "Bubble Boy" was released and one of the producers assistants of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv), 'Harvey Weintrapper' saw Gregory and his performance. In the script of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) there was a part for a white security officer, and this part was very critical to the unfolding of the whole plot of the movie. Weintrapper called Gregory in and gave him a shot at the part, Gregory with all his zeal again researched the part prior to the meeting. To understand the role he shadowed one of Caesar's Hotel security men for a day to see what it was all about. When Gregory read the part, Weintrapper was blown away, he had expected a great read from Gregory but this was beyond all expectations. Even though Gregory differed from the original characters concept, they decided to take a chance.  _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) became a stunning hit spectacular and owed this in no small way to Gregory Stenson's portrayal of The Sentry in his stunning scene that featured him along with two actors each from a Dynasty of acting Royalty. Gregory's role paired him up against the dynamic Scott Caan (James Caan's Son) and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's Brother and best buddy as well of Matt Damon). Both Scott and Casey were most impressed with Gregory's work and invited him to hang out with them after the shoot thus beginning a friendship that lasts to this day. It is a little known secret around insider circles that the three of them are looking at a "western" script to do together.</biographie>

          <biographie>Angie Dickinson was born in Kulm, North Dakota, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Brown. Mr. Brown was the publisher of The Kulm Messenger. The family left North Dakota in 1942 when Angie was 11 years old, moving to Burbank, California. In December 1946, when she was a senior at Bellamarine Jefferson High School in Burbank, she won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights Contest. Two years later, her sister Janet did likewise. Being the daughter of a printer, Angie at first had visions of becoming a writer, but gave this up after winning her first beauty contest. After finishing college, she worked as a secretary in a Burbank airplane parts factory for 3-1/2 years. In 1953, she entered the local Miss America contest one day before the deadline and took second place. In August of the same year, she was one of five winners in a beauty contest sponsored by NBC and appeared in several television variety shows. She got her first bit part in a Warner Brothers film in 1954 and gained fame in the television series _"The Millionaire" (1955)_ (qv) and got her first good film role opposite 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) and 'Dean Martin (I)' (qv) in _Rio Bravo (1959)_ (qv). Her success then spiraled until she became one of the nation's top movie stars.</biographie>

          <nom>Mac, Bernie</nom>
          <nom_naissance>McCullough, Bernard Jeffrey</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo' Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who's the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _"Midnight Mac" (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable 'Spike Lee' (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _"Moesha" (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac's star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring 'Eddie Murphy (I)' (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence's uncle in _What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _"The Bernie Mac Show" (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac's health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biographie>

          <nom>Lewis, Lennox</nom>
          <nom_naissance>Lewis, Lennox Claudius</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of 'Riddick Bowe' (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer 'Emanuel Steward' (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated 'Evander Holyfield' (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter 'Don King (I)' (qv)'s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of 'Nelson Mandela' (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis' failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought 'Mike Tyson (I)' (qv) and beaten him 'easily' in 8 rounds.</biographie>

          <biographie>As a youngster, Andres "Andy" Garcia dreamed of playing professional baseball. Born on the Island of Cuba, Garcia's family fled to Miami Beach, Florida in the United States of America following Fidel Castro's communist revolution. At Natilus Junior High School and later at Miami Beach Senior High School, Garcia excelled in baseball. In his senior year, illness prevented him from playing and he drifted into the drama department. He studied acting with 'Jay W. Jensen' (qv). Jensen was a South Florida legend, counting among his numerous students, 'Brett Ratner' (qv), 'Roy Firestone (I)' (qv), 'Mickey Rourke' (qv), and 'Luther Campbell' (qv). Following his positive high school experiences in acting, he continued his drama studies at Florida International University. From there he traveled to Hollywood, California to make his mark in movie-stardom. To his friends and fans in Miami Beach, Andy Garcia will always be remembered as a friendly, down-to-earth, all-around good guy.</biographie>

          <biographie>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, 'Eric Roberts (I)' (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia's biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People's Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biographie>

          <biographie>SHAOBO QIN (Yen), a member of the internationally acclaimed Peking Acrobats makes his motion picture debut in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.  Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats. He eventually came to the United States where he trains in Los Angeles for the company's international tours.</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Damon, Matthew Paige</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to 'Kent Damon' (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and 'Nancy Carlsson-Paige' (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5'10" star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with 'Ben Affleck' (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with 'Tom Hanks' (qv) and 'Vin Diesel' (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite 'Edward Norton (I)' (qv) and 'John Malkovich' (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, 'Ben Affleck' (qv) and fellow comedian, 'Chris Rock (I)' (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played "Tom Ripley", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both 'Jude Law' (qv) and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside 'Will Smith (I)' (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers' _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, 'Gus Van Sant' (qv) and 'Casey Affleck' (qv).  One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the "Bourne" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, "Jason Bourne", in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as "Linus Caldwell" in the "Ocean's" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite 'George Clooney' (qv), 'Brad Pitt' (qv), 'Julia Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Don Cheadle' (qv) in _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in 'Terry Gilliam' (qv)'s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv)'s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and 'Robert De Niro' (qv)'s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born 'Luciana Barroso' (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Brad Pitt' (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor 'Ben Affleck' (qv), together with Ben's wife, 'Jennifer Garner (I)' (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife, 'Luciana Barroso' (qv).</biographie>

          <nom_naissance>Caan, Scott Andrew</nom_naissance>
          <biographie>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a "man's-man" like his father, legendary actor 'James Caan (I)' (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like 'Marlon Brando' (qv) and 'Sean Penn (I)' (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent's homes. His mom is actress and model 'Sheila Ryan (II)' (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father's hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son's little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend 'The Alchemist' (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and 'Gregg Araki' (qv)'s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director 'Tony Scott (I)' (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott's star rose with a fun supporting turn in 'Steven Soderbergh' (qv)'s _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - 'Nicolas Cage' (qv)'s directorial debut starring 'James Franco' (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean's Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in 'Nicole Holofcener' (qv)'s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan's return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean's Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _"Entourage" (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _"Hawaii Five-0" (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer 'Phil Parmet' (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biographie>
